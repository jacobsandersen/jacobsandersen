### Hello!

My name is Jacob. I (mostly) go by `simple` or `simpleauthority` online. My pronouns are `he/him`. If you see me around, feel free to say hi!

A lot of my work is either related to Minecraft, on projects such as [Paper](https://papermc.io) and [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org), or various web development ventures making use of Vue or React.

Right now, I am focused on school while working on code in my free time.

If you want to reach out, you can:
- Find me on Discord: `simple#5957`
- Find me on Twitter: `@simpleauthority`
